            Recently, the restaurant bought the building next-door, and it has expanded its seating area, as a result.
            With the increase in its capacity, the restaurant is anticipating an equal increase in patrons. 
            However, its current manpower is not enough to handle the uptick in the patrons, especially in short term.
            So the chatbot called Betsy is designed to handle, primarily, the reservation process.
            In addition to handling reservation, the chatbot would like to help in promoting the restaurant, at least to the new customers.
            He is in the lower right corner of the page. Just click it and talk to her if needed.
